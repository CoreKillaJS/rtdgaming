//ABOUT:
//-------------------
//The damage filters need to be setup so that objects that are team based
//do not get damaged by its teammates. Unfortunaletly the "filter_activator_tfteam" entites 
//cannot be through Sourcemod so that's why this is here.
//
//USAGE:
//-------------------
//Using EntSpy (http://www.bagthorpe.org/bob/cofrdrbob/entspy.html) it is very easy to find 
//out the damage filters used in a map. 
//
//1.) Search for "filter_activator_tfteam"
//2.) You will see 2 entites named "filter_activator_tfteam" it should be fairly easy to
//		distinguish which one is for BLUE and which one is for RED, if it has some
//		obscure name then look at the "TeamNum" value. 
//		TeamNum 3 = Blue Team
//		TeamNum 2 = Red Team
//
//Layout:
//-------------------
//"map_Name"
//{
//	"Blu"	"BlueTeamFilter"
//	"Red"	"RedTeamFilter"
//}
